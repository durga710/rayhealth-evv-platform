/**
 * Requests OS notification permission for clock-in/out reminders.
 *
 * Design decisions:
 * - Asks only once per device installation (persisted via SecureStore).
 * - Should be called after the caregiver's first successful clock-in,
 *   not at app launch — we wait for genuine user intent (per Apple HIG
 *   and the existing "deferred notification permission" pattern in the
 *   handoff docs from 2026-05-09).
 * - Safe to call on any platform (expo-notifications is a no-op on web).
 *
 * Returns:
 *   'granted'     — permission was granted (or was already granted)
 *   'denied'      — user declined
 *   'already_asked' — prior call recorded; OS was not re-prompted
