/**
 * Baseline migration runner — applies the inlined `schema.ts` migrations
 * idempotently via knex.schema.hasTable/hasColumn guards. Invoked by
 * `npm run db:migrate`.
 *
 * Six of the seven other dated 2026-05-11 migrations (learning, sandata,
 * retention, etc.) referenced by an earlier `apply-new-migrations.ts`
 * script live in a separate monorepo and have not been ported into this
 * repo yet. The features that depend on them (Learning Hub, audit
 * retention sweep, agency Sandata config) are tracked as pending
 * engineering work in PROJECT_STATUS.md.
 *
 * `extend-visit-maintenance` and its 2026-06-30 backfill ARE wired in
 * below — VisitMaintenanceRepository's tenant-scoping fix depends on the
 * `agency_id` column they add/populate, so they can't be left orphaned
 * like the rest. Both are idempotent (hasColumn guards / `WHERE agency_id
 * IS NULL`), safe to re-run.
 *
 * Writes status to stderr (not stdout) so the parent shell can pipe stdout
 * for JSON without contamination. No `console.*` calls — keeps `npm run
 * lint` clean and matches the codebase's no-console-in-prod posture.
