 * caregiver be physically present at the client's address when the visit
 * starts and ends. We enforce that by comparing the GPS lat/lng captured
 * by the mobile app against the client's registered address coordinates,
 * within a per-client `geofence_radius_m` (defaulting to 150 m at the
 * column level, this module treats `null` radius as "use 150").
 *
 * Distance is computed via the Haversine formula on a spherical Earth,
 * which is accurate to ~0.5% over the distances we care about. Anything
 * tighter (Vincenty etc.) is overkill at a 150 m gate.

 *
 * Fail-open rationale: agencies onboarding new clients will not have GPS
 * coordinates registered yet; rejecting clock-in for them would block the
 * pilot demo and any field rollout where address geocoding is back-filled
 * out-of-band. As soon as an agency sets `latitude` + `longitude` on a
 * client row, the geofence engages. Out-of-bounds attempts are still
 * audited (`permission.denied` with reason: 'geofence') so the policy
 * gap is observable.
 *
 * Note: GPS `accuracy` (meters of reported uncertainty) is intentionally
 * NOT subtracted from the distance here, accuracy values reported by
 * mobile OSes are noisy and would let a caregiver "borrow" 50 m by
 * spoofing low confidence. We treat the reported point as authoritative.
