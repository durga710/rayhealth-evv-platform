# Legal Onboarding & Hiring Templates

A drop-in package of legal, HIPAA, and HR documents that homecare agencies can customize once and reuse for every new client and new hire. Generic templates are stored in `client-onboarding/`, `hiring/`, and `state-addenda/`. An agency runs one script (or asks Gemini) to fill in their info, and gets a complete, printable, signable PDF and Word package back.

> **Heads up:** This package ships only `.docx` masters. PDFs are produced at convert-time from those masters (see [Producing PDFs](#producing-pdfs)). There is no committed `pdf/` directory.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1) Install dependencies (one-time, kept outside the repo)
python3 -m venv /tmp/legal-templates-venv
/tmp/legal-templates-venv/bin/pip install python-docx

# 2) Generate the 25 master .docx files (run once after pulling)
cd resources/legal-templates
/tmp/legal-templates-venv/bin/python scripts/generate_docs.py

# 3) Fill in your agency details
$EDITOR agency-info.json

# 4) Produce a customized package
/tmp/legal-templates-venv/bin/python scripts/customize.py
# -> writes customized/<your-agency-slug>/docx/*.docx
```

Prefer to delegate the typing? Use `GEMINI_PROMPT.md` — paste it into Gemini along with your brochure / website screenshot and it will produce a filled `agency-info.json` for you.

## Customizing

`agency-info.json` holds every agency-level placeholder. Edit it once for your agency and rerun `customize.py` whenever something changes (new license number, new privacy officer, new rate schedule).

Per-client and per-employee fields (`{{CLIENT_NAME}}`, `{{HIRE_DATE}}`, `{{POSITION_TITLE}}`, etc.) intentionally remain as blank lines (`____________________`) in the customized output — fill those by hand at signing.

### Required fields in `agency-info.json`

| Group | Keys |
|---|---|
| Identity | `AGENCY_SLUG`, `AGENCY_NAME`, `AGENCY_LEGAL_ENTITY_TYPE`, `AGENCY_ADDRESS_LINE_1`, `AGENCY_ADDRESS_LINE_2`, `AGENCY_CITY`, `AGENCY_STATE`, `AGENCY_ZIP`, `AGENCY_PHONE`, `AGENCY_FAX`, `AGENCY_EMAIL`, `AGENCY_WEBSITE` |
| Licensure | `AGENCY_LICENSE_NUMBER`, `AGENCY_LICENSE_STATE`, `AGENCY_TAX_ID_EIN`, `PA_HOMECARE_LICENSE`, `OH_PROVIDER_NUMBER` |
| Roles | `PRIVACY_OFFICER_NAME/EMAIL/PHONE`, `COMPLIANCE_OFFICER_NAME/EMAIL`, `HR_CONTACT_NAME/EMAIL` |
| Rates | `HOURLY_RATE`, `OVERTIME_RATE`, `HOLIDAY_RATE`, `MILEAGE_RATE`, `MINIMUM_VISIT_HOURS` |
| Billing | `LATE_PAYMENT_FEE_PCT`, `INVOICE_FREQUENCY`, `PAYMENT_DUE_DAYS` |
| Dates / notice | `EFFECTIVE_DATE`, `NOTICE_PERIOD_DAYS` |
| Regulators | `STATE_REGULATOR_NAME/PHONE/WEBSITE`, `APS_PHONE/WEBSITE`, `PA_DEPT_HEALTH_PHONE`, `OH_DEPT_HEALTH_PHONE` |
| Insurance | `INSURANCE_LIABILITY_LIMIT`, `INSURANCE_AUTO_LIMIT`, `WORKERS_COMP_CARRIER` |

`AGENCY_SLUG` should be a kebab-case version of your agency name (e.g. `acme-homecare`); it controls the output directory under `customized/`.

## Producing PDFs

PDFs are not committed. Generate them on demand from the customized `.docx` files using LibreOffice:

```bash
# macOS (one-time)
brew install --cask libreoffice

# Convert all customized .docx -> .pdf
cd customized/<your-agency-slug>/docx
libreoffice --headless --convert-to pdf *.docx --outdir ../pdf
```

The same command works on Linux. On Windows use `soffice.exe --headless --convert-to pdf`.

## Disclaimer

**This package is a starting point. It is not legal advice.**

Each generated document carries a footer disclaimer reading:

> *This template is provided as a starting point and does not constitute legal advice. Have a healthcare-experienced attorney licensed in {{AGENCY_STATE}} review and customize before use.*

Before any of these documents are presented to a client, employee, regulator, or court:

- Have a healthcare-experienced attorney licensed in your operating state review every document.
- Verify state-specific citations are still current (statutes and agency phone numbers change).
- Confirm your insurance limits, license number, and tax identification are correct.
- Confirm your HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices reflects your actual uses and disclosures, not just the regulatory floor.
- Replace synthetic example values in `agency-info.json` (such as `(215) 555-0100` or `00-0000000`) with your real agency information.

The authors of this package, the rayhealth-evv-platform project, and any contributors disclaim any liability for use of these templates without legal review.
