# RayHealth EVV — Control Evidence Register

**Version:** 1.1
**Effective:** 2026-07-16
**Owner:** Privacy Officer / Security Officer

This register says what evidence must exist and when. Actual screenshots,
exports, signed agreements, access lists, incident notes, secrets, and PHI stay
in the private compliance vault—not Git. Use opaque IDs such as
`CE-2026-Q3-ACCESS-01` in this file and in the vault.

An unchecked box or an automated workflow file is not evidence by itself. The
evidence is the dated result, reviewer, environment, and retained artifact.
